Preprocessed and merged data (project/src/data/processed/mergedData.csv):
- The datasets contains values from 2002 to 2017
- The first row of the file contains the column titles (= the header).
- Every row afterwards contains values separated by a semi-colon:
  index; year; global near surface temperature deviation; number of children born in Vienna

Time series plot (project/plots/timeSeriesLinePlot.jpg):
- The x-axis depicts the years of the sampled data and ranges from 2002 to 2017
- There are two y-axises:
    > the left one depicts the global temperature deviations and belongs to the blue curve (Temp dev)
    > the right one depicts the number of live-births in Vienna and belongs to the red curve (Live-births)


Scatter plot (project/plots/scatterPlotWithLinearModel.jpg):
- The x-axis depicts the global near surface temperature deviation
- The y-axis depicts the number of live-births in Vienna
- The black dots represent data points
- The blue line shows a linear regression model fitted to the data
- the grey area guarding the blue prediction line depicts the 95% confidence interval of the respective prediction
